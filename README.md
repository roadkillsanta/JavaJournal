# [SOLID] 
## S - Single responsibility
Every class has its own purpose. For example, each controller was responsible for its own window elements: Controller is solely responsible for the main window; WeekController is responsible for the week view.

## O - Open/closed principle
This project is open for extension but closed for modification. It demonstrates this by extensively implementing the MVC paradigm. For example, the AbstractOccurrence class creates a template for an occurrence for the program. It can be easily extended by creating a new class which extends it, and this functionality can be easily dropped into the relevant controllers.

## L - Liskov substitution
The AbstractOccurrence class, the Event class, and the Task class adhere to this principle. Wherever an AbstractOccurrence appears, an Event or a Task can easily be used in its place with no errors.

## I - Interface segregation principle
There were no interfaces used in this project. This adheres to this principle because in a typical MVC project, the controller has an interface which allows it to be extended. However, each controller in this project is responsible for its own windows and elements, thus they share very few (if any) common methods.

## D - Dependency inversion
The sole examples of this in this project are within the controller classes, which is dependent on the Abstract version of Events and Tasks, namely the AbstractOccurrence. 

## Extending the project
Many additional features can be easily implemented with just a few modifications to the project. For example, "Quotes and Notes" can be added as a new data structure which can be linked into the Week and WeekRecord classes. Loading and rending these would be handled in the WeekController.
